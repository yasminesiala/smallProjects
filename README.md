# Small Projects Folder

## A series of mini projects/assignments I've worked on over the last two years (primarily in C)

Directory:
- LRC game: Simulates the dice game Left, Center, Right in C. 
- Data Compression: Implements a lossless text file compressor and decompressor using a nibble-based encoding scheme inspired by the original MacWrite algorithm.
- xd: A simplified version of the Unix xxd utility. It reads a file or standard input and prints its contents in hexadecimal and ASCII format.
